# My dotfiles

## Installations

To install these dotfiles you need to install the following dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install neovim stow zoxide fzf
```

After that clone the Repo into a directory of your choosing and run `stow .` in the cloned directory. Make sure to create a copy of the dotfiles.
